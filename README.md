# Social-Distancing-Detector
In this, I am attaching my code for building a Social Distancing Detector to detect if a crowd is practicing Social Distancing or not using a sample video.

Social Distancing is a term that has gained much popularity over the past few months majorly due to the global pandemic. People are forced to maintain a sufficient amount of distance between each other to prevent the spread of this deadly virus. Amidst this crisis, I decided to build a simple Social Distancing Detector that could monitor the practice of social distancing in a crowd.



Download the yolov3.weights file from [Here]( https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PiyO7VLehaQtbGAPdLHaGo3ucVWSNeVC/view?usp=sharing) and add it to the folder for this program.
