# Social-Distancing-Detector
In this, I am attaching my code for building a Social Distancing Detector to detect if a crowd is practicing Social Distancing or not using a sample video.

Social Distancing is one such terminology that has gained popularity over the past few months, thanks to COVID-19. People are forced to maintain a sufficient amount of distance between each other to prevent the spread of this deadly virus. Amidst this crisis, I decided to build a simple Social Distancing Detector that could monitor the practice of social distancing in a crowd.
